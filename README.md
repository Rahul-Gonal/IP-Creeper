This is IP Creeper, the newer version of the best IP info scraping tool built in python.
It was coded by me after taking Harvard's CS50p course which greatly opened my mind to newer syntaxes and functions. It is built on ip-api and shodan api.
The first one doesn't require any api key but shodan does which one can get for free from developers.shodan.io.
The shodan key can have some defects so please contact shodan if you have any problems with Api Key

The main project has three main functions:
1. To show the user IP address
2. To generate a random IP address
3. To lookup IP addresses at ip-api and Shodan
